Claim Your Coinbase Onchain Verified Role 🔵

Aside from creating content, building products, and trading onchain, this might become one of the strongest criteria if 
@base
 ever does an airdrop — so make sure you’re verified early

Getting the role is super easy:

▪️Create a Coinbase account (if you don’t have one yet)
▪️Go to http://coinbase.com/onchain-verify and connect your wallet — use the same wallet you’re using on Galxe
▪️Visit http://guild.xyz/base/home to check if the role has been assigned
▪️Finally, check Discord to confirm that the role shows up on your profile

That’s it.
Better be prepared now than regret it later
